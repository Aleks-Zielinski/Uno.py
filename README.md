# Uno.py
Uno game made in Python  
The game has 4 color cards with +2 and +4 type of cards  
# How does it work?
When you launch game it asks you about settings  
It doesn't ask you for number of computer players because it calculates it by NumberOfPlayers - NumberOfHumanPlayers

After setting it the game starts  
First it asks you for your move but before it, it shows a sign telling you to give computer to the persons whose move it is

Next move belongs to computer. The computer takes random card that can be placed, if there is none, it takes one card
