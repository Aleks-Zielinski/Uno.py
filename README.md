# How does it work?
When you launch game it asks you about settings  
It doesn't ask you for number of computer players because it calculates it by NumberOfPlayers - NumberOfHumanPlayers  
![Settings](https://github.com/Aleks-Zielinski/Uno.py/blob/main/assets%20for%20readme/custom-settings.png "Settings")  
After setting it the game starts  
First it asks you for your move but before it, it shows a sign telling you to give computer to the persons whose move it is  
![Shows cards](https://github.com/Aleks-Zielinski/Uno.py/blob/main/assets%20for%20readme/showing-cards.png "Shows cards")  
Then it prints your move  
![Printed move](https://github.com/Aleks-Zielinski/Uno.py/blob/main/assets%20for%20readme/human-move.png "Printed move")  
Next move belongs to computer. The computer takes random card that can be placed, if there is none, it takes one card  
![Computer move](https://github.com/Aleks-Zielinski/Uno.py/blob/main/assets%20for%20readme/computer-move.png "Computer move")  
![Takes extra card](https://github.com/Aleks-Zielinski/Uno.py/blob/main/assets%20for%20readme/computer-extra-card.png "Takes extra card")  
After someone reaches point of having 0 cards it prints who won and asks you if you want to play again, if you do then it asks you again for settings
